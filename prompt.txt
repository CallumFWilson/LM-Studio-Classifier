We are automating the classification of text segments from peace agreements. Each segment should be tagged with one or more topic codes based on their semantic meaning.

The list of topic codes is provided in an ontology table with the following columns:
- Code: a short identifier
- Descriptor: a short phrase describing the topic (e.g., Participation)
- Include (optional): examples or phrases that should be included under this code
- Exclude (optional): examples or phrases that should be excluded under this code

### Instructions:
- Tag a segment with a particular Code if its content is semantically similar to the Descriptor.
- If Include guidance is given, make sure the segment aligns with that.
- If Exclude guidance is given, do **not** tag the segment if it matches excluded content.
- Some segments may match multiple Codes — return **all applicable Codes**.
- Your output for each segment should be a **list of codes**, with each code matching one listed in the ontology exactly.

### Remember:

1. Base semantic similarity on:
   - Main subjects/objects
   - Main actions/verbs
   - Key relationships
   - Topic alignment
   - Level of detail
   - Temporal aspects
   - Purpose/intent
   - Scope/scale
   - Relationships between concepts
   - Core ideas and context
   - Implications and consequences

2. Focus on conceptual meaning, **not** surface words.
   - Do **not** tag based solely on key terms.
   - Proper nouns (like “England”) are not enough on their own.
   - Always justify your match by **meaning**, not just phrasing.
   - Exclude borderline matches based on superficial similarity.
   - Only tag if part of the descriptor clearly applies.

3. Descriptors may contain several ideas. Matching to **any** of them is sufficient.

4. Be consistent: tag segments according to the same standard across all cases.

5. Output should only include **label codes** that appear exactly as listed in the ontology.
   - Do **not** invent or infer new codes.
   - Only include codes present in the provided ontology.
   - Output format must be a list of valid codes

You will be provided with:
- A table of classification codes (ontology)
- A  `segment_text` entry to classify

### Your task:
For each `segment_text`, return the list of ontology codes that best match the semantic meaning of the segment.
